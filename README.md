# Description
This project idea is brought up by Victor(my partner) who also explains the theoretical part. Meanwhile, the research & development part are carried out by me (vibing-onion).

The project is based on the concept of convergence trading and tries to demonstrate the relationship between highly correlated stocks. 

May find out more details on our website @ https://vibing-onion.github.io/Stock-Correlation-Analysis/

# Updates
The current GUI code is not maintained due to upcoming transformation onto flask framework.

# Caution
The project is only for entertainment purpose and does not provide any suggestions in trading or investment.
