        "In this case, Royal Dutch Shell and Shell Transportation both share the same parent company, voting rights and preemptive rights. The only slight difference between these 2 companies is the tax treatment. In fact, they share an extremely high correlation in stock price, which are a metaphor to the brown eggs and white eggs in the aforementioned examples. Long Term Capital Management observed a more deviated price difference between them and applied a convergence trade strategy, betting that their price will converge in the future and earn an arbitrage profit from it."
