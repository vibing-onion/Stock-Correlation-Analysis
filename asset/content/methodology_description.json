        "In this project, we want to discover the correlations among listed companies in HKEx based on the stock price and the optimized buy / sell timing.",
        "Having the pain points distinguished, we extract the historical stock price in the past 18 years, from 2005 to 2022, covering a much longer period so that more black swan events such as Financial Crisis in 2008 and Outbreak of Covid-19 in 2020.",
        "The data is stored as .csv file with the help of yfinance and pandas libraries at the very beginning to avoid scraping them while processing the data. We then use a function returning a matrix of Pearson correlation (from 0 to 1) among the companies and filter the result where only pairs with 90% correlated (~150) are kept as our targets.",
        "In convergence trading, spread between the two targets has to be known so that we can decide the moment to buy as the spread is very likely (90%) to become smaller. By comparing the ranges, the stock prices can be scaled and translated to a similar level (Projected Price). After matching them together, we call the mean as “Correct Price” and look for the 90% quantile of the spread so theoretically there will be only 10% of chance that the relative movement of stock price will NOT follow our expectation. Hence, it is the time to buy the stock with a lower Projected Price.",
        "After all, we use matplotlib library to visualize the stock price and further pack them into a GUI (Graphical User Interface) with tkinter library for a better user experience. Users can simply input “start date”, “end date” (in form of “yyyy-mm-dd”) and any 2 valid yfinance tickers (eg. 1052.HK) in the GUI to get a visualized representation of the data, instead of going deep into the code and changing the parameters."
