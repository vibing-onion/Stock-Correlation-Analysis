        "As a matter of fact, since the correlation of bonds is much higher than that of stocks, most of the convergence trade is applied in the bond market. Using 30-year US Treasury Bill as an example, it should share a very similar price to the the US Treasury bill which 29 years to maturity theoretically. However, as the newer 30-year US Treasury Bill is a more liquid financial product in the market, it should be slightly higher than the 29-year US T-bill when it is just issued. Recall the criteria to apply convergence trade: high correlation and difference in price movement. In this case, we can long the 29-year T-bill and short the newly issued 30-year T-bill and earn the arbitrage profit."
