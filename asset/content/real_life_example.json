        "In this case, Royal Dutch Shell and Shell Transportation both share the same parent company, voting rights and preemptive rights. The only slight difference between these 2 companies is the tax treatment. In fact, they share an extremely high correlation in stock price, which are a metaphor to the brown eggs and white eggs in the aforementioned examples. Long Term Capital Management observed a more deviated price difference between them and applied a convergence trade strategy, betting that their price will converge in the future and earn an arbitrage profit from it.",
        "As a matter of fact, since the correlation of bonds is much higher than that of stocks, most of the convergence trade is applied in the bond market. Using 30-year US Treasury Bill as an example, it should share a very similar price to the the US Treasury bill which 29 years to maturity theoretically. However, as the newer 30-year US Treasury Bill is a more liquid financial product in the market, it should be slightly higher than the 29-year US T-bill when it is just issued. Recall the criteria to apply convergence trade: high correlation and difference in price movement. In this case, we can long the 29-year T-bill and short the newly issued 30-year T-bill and earn the arbitrage profit."
