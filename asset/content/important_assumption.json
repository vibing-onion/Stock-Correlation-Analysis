        "With cheap leverage, low standard deviation, and almost riskless arbitrage profit, the strategy is actually close to flawless. However, to ensure a sustainable arbitrage, there is actually a very important assumption behind: No black swan event happens.",
        "A black swan refers to a very negative event that has a very low probability â€“ not likely to happen but still has a small chance to happen. In the financial market, typical black swans examples are the default of national debt and large scale financial crises. These black swan events usually result in a market panic, which people cash out from the stock market since they lose faith in it. As a result, all the strategies in the portfolio will basically share the higher correlation (due to the systematic risk) and the probability of convergence will be much smaller in the short run. From the perspective of unrealised loss in accounting, the investors will bear loss for a long time. And given a surge in standard deviation and leverage, the loss of portfolio will be greatly multiplied."
